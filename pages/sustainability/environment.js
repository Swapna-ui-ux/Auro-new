									<h2>Environment</h2>
								<p>Environmental impacts form a core aspect of our operational planning and our EHS initiatives form part of our Sustainability initiatives. We provide relevant information, training and support to all our employees to increase their awareness of the hazards and risks that are associated with our operations. Major API manufacturing units in Telangana state have demonstrated compliance with Zero Liquid Discharge requirements.
									<br/>To reduce the company’s carbon footprint, we have established a 30 MW captive solar power plant at Varisam, Srikakulam District, Andhra Pradesh which is now fully functional.</p>
								<h4>LIQUID DISCHARGE</h4>
								<p>We conform to all regulations for the disposal of wastewater to Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs) or marine discharge across our formulation units and API facilities. We have developed new initiatives for treatment of wastewater using advanced technologies like membrane bio-reactors that complement our expansion projects in some of our API manufacturing locations.</p>
								<h4>SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT</h4>
								<p>We continue to follow the standardized practice for disposing of organic waste, of sending this to cement units for reuse as auxiliary fuel in kilns. We use Treatment, Storage and Disposal Facilities (TSDF) to manage our inorganic and miscellaneous solid wastes. We have also commenced new initiatives for additional control measures on fugitive emissions at the waste treatment facilities of some of our API units. These initiatives include providing hoods on wastewater storage tanks and arranging additional scrubbers, amongst other projects. Additionally, our API units are equipped with monitoring instruments for continuous assessments of fugitive emissions on the premises. During FY 2017-18, we started vermi-composting garden and kitchen waste in one of our API manufacturing units. The pilot project was highly successful and going forward, we will implement the same project across our other units.</p>
								<h4>ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT</h4>
								<p>To help monitor and limit our emissions, we have installed online continuous emissions monitoring systems across our manufacturing units and these are also connected to the central and state pollution control boards. We completed our public consultation process for the expansion of Aurobindo Unit XI and are preparing for the submission of our Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report to the Ministry of Environment and Forests &amp; Climate Change (MoEF &amp; CC). During FY 2017-18, various customers conducted environment assessments functions across our API and DP formulations units. We also worked towards enriching the environment through the following programs: planted 7,000 trees and 2,000 shrubs over~1 lakh square meters of land across manufacturing locations; collaborated with the government to develop environmental awareness initiatives like Vanamahostavam by the Government of India, Vanam–Manam by the Government of Andhra Pradesh; and Telangana Ku Haritha Haram by the Government of Telangana.</p>
								<h4>SAFETY FIRST</h4>
								<p>In our drive to improve safety culture, to change behavior and thought process, behavior-based safety programs are being implemented across the business. Software modelling and quantitative risk assessment tools like PHAST software are used to identify hazards, and mitigate risks from bulk flammable material storage. Sprinkler systems have also been installed as an additional layer of safety for bulk solvent storage yards. We initiate safety pep-talks before every shift on the hazards of activities and the necessary precautions to be taken in case of a mishap. We also conduct Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) and risk analysis for all new products and safety tests are conducted for all new chemicals. Historical events including injuries and other incidents are analysed and actions initiated to address the common root causes. We have put in place a training matrix for contract workers based on their activities, and special training modules for managing and leading safety have been implemented for production heads.&nbsp; Activity based risk assessments conducted three to four years earlier were re-visited and updated during 2018.</p>
								<h4>ANTI-MICROBIAL RESISTANCE (AMR) – A GLOBAL THREAT</h4>
								<p>Since 2015, there has been an intense focus by the international media on policy-level discussions over anti-microbial resistance (AMR). This has also raised concerns over the pharmaceutical industry in India and Hyderabad in particular. Aurobindo recognizes AMR as a serious global concern that needs to be tackled through a comprehensive and multi-pronged strategy.
									<br/>The Antimicrobial Resistance Benchmark is the first independent, detailed benchmarking of how pharmaceutical companies are working to prevent the rise of drug resistance. It is led by the Access to Medicine Foundation, an independent non-profit organization based in the Netherlands working in collaboration with experts and specialists from across the spectrum of organizations trying to curb antimicrobial resistance. Aurobindo collaborated in the 2018 benchmarking exercise and the Antimicrobial Resistance Benchmark 2018 report was published in January, 2018. The proposed 2020 AMR Benchmark will include more indicators with participation of 30 companies including Aurobindo.</p>
