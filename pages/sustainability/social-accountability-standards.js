									<h4>1. Social Compliance Certification</h4>
									<p>India Formulation selected Facilities are certified for SA 8000 Standards by DNV GL, headquartered in Norway and having accreditation from Social Accountability Accreditation Services(SAAS) for conducting SA 8000 certification.</p>
									<p>SA 8000 is an auditable certification standard that encourages organizations to develop, maintain, and apply socially acceptable practices in the workplace. The foundational elements of this Standard are based on the UN Declaration of Human Rights, Conventions of the ILO, international human rights norms and national labor laws.</p>
